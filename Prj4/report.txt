-Was able to finish
-did not use banned STL componenets
-I believe I fixed all the bugs so far
-I implemented the whole code first but radixTree, than I started debugging.
I first used map from stl before I actually implement RadixTree.
I tried using datas from members.txt, and some random datas to see if it gives correct output that it is not valid.
As the output seems to be correct, I implemented RadixTree trying to implement map of my own.
